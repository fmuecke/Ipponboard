Ipponboard is a score board specially designed for Judo tournaments that features an innovative control via gamepad, mouse, or keyboard. The main goals in its development were good readability and easy, intuitive control.

# Why it's *so* cool!

- Reliability, ease and straightforward in use
- Everything in view: clocks, scores, fighters, lists – as well as for the audience, coaches and the fighters
- Whole fight control can be done by a single person instead of three (clocks, list handling, scores)
- Thanks to the innovative gamepad control you can keep track of the fight instead of looking for your mous cursor

## Even more features

- Automated list handling for team matches (including PDF export of the results)
- Golden Score automatism
- Automatic addition of penalties and hold scores
- New clubs can be easily added with the club manager
- Customizable mat signal and label
- Customizable colors (instead of the default blue and white)
