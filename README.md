Ipponboard is a score board specially designed for Judo tournaments that features an innovative control via gamepad, 
mouse, or keyboard. The main goals in its development were good readability and easy, intuitive control.

# Fork of https://github.com/fmuecke/Ipponboard.git
This is a fork of Florian Mückes great Ipponboard. 
I decided to use a fork to process pull requests independently and merge them back into a master. 
The commit and git-branch history should document all adjustments. If Florian likes some of these ideas, 
I would be happy if they were incorporated into the original project.

# Why it's *so* cool!

- Reliability, ease and straightforward in use
- Everything in view: clocks, scores, fighters, lists – as well as for the audience, coaches and the fighters
- Whole fight control can be done by a single person instead of three (clocks, list handling, scores)
- Thanks to the innovative gamepad control you can keep track of the fight instead of looking for your mous cursor

## Even more features

- Automated list handling for team matches (including PDF export of the results)
- Golden Score automatism
- Automatic addition of penalties and hold scores
- New clubs can be easily added with the club manager
- Customizable mat signal and label
- Customizable colors (instead of the default blue and white)
