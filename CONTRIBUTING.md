# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project stay alive.

You can conribute to Ipponboard in lots of different ways:

- Report bugs and discuss issues
- Test the program
- Contribute code
- Specify requiremens (e.g. new or different rule sets)
- Submit club logos and information 

I want you to be able contribute your ideas and input that you're exited about. So, don't hesitate and contact the author.

## Submitting changes

Please use pull requests with a clear list of what you've done.
Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

Thanks! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
